# Script/Talking Points
## Slide 1: What is LC and what workshops does it provide?
- The Carpentries is a non-profit organization dedicated to building computational and data science skills in the research community through inclusive, hands-on workshops. Library Carpentry – one of three established workshop curricula - is designed to introduce computational methods applicable to library work.
- The standard Library Carpentry workshop is held over two days and is comprised of four lessons: 
  - Introduction to working with data and Regular Expressions
   - The UNIX Shell
   - Introduction to Github
   - Introduction to OpenRefine
- Lesson plans, with scripts and exercises, are available on the Library Carpentry website. The lessons focus on hands-on technical exercises. Traditionally, the workshops were held in person for groups of up to about 40 participants, with two “certified” Carpentries instructors and at least 1 helper for every 10 participants. There is a Carpentries Code of Conduct that emphasizes an inclusive learning environment and some teaching tools and assessment methods prescribed by the organization. 
- You can host a “centrally organized” workshop, where you pay an administrative fee to the Carpentries and they recruit instructors for you and provide some planning support. Or you can opt for a “self-hosted” workshop, which is free (aside from any instructor travel costs, if it’s an in person workshop) as long as you let them know about the workshop, secure your own “Certified” instructors,  and follow certain guidelines. 
## Slide 2: Our experience with LC workshops

### Logistics
- **event administration:** After cancelling a planned in-person workshop in March 2020, our The Network of the National Library of Medicine, Region 1 (then the Southeastern Atlantic Region) hosted two online Library Carpentry workshops for librarians across the region.  
- **instructor and helper recruitment:** The workshops were centrally organized; The Carpentries recruited instructors from their worldwide network of volunteers. Kiri reached out to colleagues whom she knew had knowledge of the material that would be covered during the workshop. 
- **student recruitment:** The workshops were advertised in the NNLM blog, on the MLA data-sig listserv, and in data-related NNLM on-demand courses. Participants filled out a Qualtrics form to “apply”/register, and sessions were capped at 20 participants. We also reached out to LIS programs in the region to promote the opportunity to LIS students. 
- **Virtual event hosting and other online facilitation:** workshops were held over Zoom. We used etherpad as a collaborative notes document, which also allowed us to get immediate feedback from users. 
### Workshops
#### First workshop:
  - The first workshop was held on the afternoons of November 3rd-6th 2020 and was comprised of the four core lessons of the Library Carpentry curriculum: Introduction to Working with Data and Regular Expressions, the UNIX Shell, Introduction to Git, and OpenRefine.
 - It was centrally organized, and the Carpentries organization recruited four volunteer instructors for the workshop. Kiri managed registration, communicated with participants, and hosted the Zoom meeting. Brian, JP, and Amy served as helpers during the event. 
 - The workshop was held online, via Zoom Meetings. Most of the participants were staff from the UMB Library. 
#### Challenges: 
 - Having never been to a workshop before, we didn’t have a clear idea of how long the lessons and exercises would take. There are time estimates included during the lesson plans, but the online format introduced new variables.  
- Without being able to see people, it was hard to know who needed assistance, whether or not everyone was following along, and when people generally were finished with exercises.  
- In a Zoom meeting room, it was tough to give everyone the individual help they needed. People seemed less inclined to ask for help when they needed it, and didn’t want to unmute or share their screen with the group. If we wanted to provide one-on-one help in a breakout room, participants fell behind the rest of the class and it was hard to catch up. 
- We had a different instructor for each lesson, and instructors were often not present for the lessons they weren’t teaching. This made it hard to adjust as the workshop progressed.
#### Solutions: 
As the first workshop progressed, we learned how to use breakout rooms more effectively, which allowed for more individualized pacing and one-on-one problem solving. Kiri created a breakout room for each helper, and assigned each participant to a breakout room. We fell into a rhythm of about 20 minutes of lecture and demonstration from the instructor, and then adjourning to breakout rooms for exercises and questions. Since our helpers were so knowledgeable, they could adapt to their small group’s needs and spend the time either problem-solving or digging further into the material. Participants could focus more on the lecture and demonstrations, knowing that they’d have the chance to ask questions and resolve problems in the small groups. 
#### Second workshop
- The second workshop was held over two days, from March 25th – 26th. It was another centrally organized workshop, and the Carpentries recruited volunteer instructors.  
- We adjusted the curriculum based on experience from the first workshop and the expertise of the instructors who volunteered. We decided to request a lesson called “Introduction to Tidy Data for Librarians” in place of the Git/Github lesson, because it fit better within the timeframe and provided a “friendlier”, less intimidating start to the workshop. We also replaced the OpenRefine lesson with a brief introduction to R, because we needed to accommodate the expertise of the instructors who volunteered.
- Based on our experience and participant feedback from the first workshop, we built in more time for breaks and for computer set-up and questions in between lessons. We also had our breakout room strategy established from the start. And everyone, Library Carpentry instructors included, had several months’ more practice with virtual teaching, virtual events, and virtual workshops! 
## Slide 3: Working toward self-hosting LC workshops
### Our experience becoming Carpentry Instructors
  - NNLM also sponsored a Carpentries instructor training session. This helps expand the network of instructors available for further NNLM sponsored carpentries classes.  
  - Three of us from the HSHSL were able to take part in this opportunity, so we will also have the capacity to organize carpentries workshops for our own community, in addition to becoming part of NNLM’s network.
- Teacher Training
  - Carpentries teacher training follows the same intensive two day format as the regular Carpentries workshops. The training focuses on the Carpentries pedagogy, rather than the technical skills taught, and also covers the logistical aspects of running workshops and contributing to carpentries lessons. 
- Check out: In addition to completing the training, Certified carpentries instructors must complete three additional steps: 
  - contributing to a lesson (the lessons are maintained on GitHub)
  - taking part in a discussion group
  - short teaching demo with feedback from an experienced instructor and peers.
  - After checkout is completed Instructors are considered certified to teach any Carpentries curriculum.
### Advantages and challenges we foresee with self-hosting
- Advantage: more control over planning
  - Able to set our own timeline and adjust curriculum to meet the expertise of instructors and needs of community.
  - Advantage: build rapport between instructors. Smoother co-teaching experience. Instructors have worked together before and can integrate the flow of the workshop better with more time to plan together beforehand
- Advantage: don’t have to pay administrative fee for each workshop. 
- Advantage: build relationships with our community as we become go-to people for teaching these early computation skills
- Challenge: more time intensive, because we are also responsible for the administrative side of things.
### Next up! 
We will teaching/organizing the next NNLM Region 1 Library Carpentry workshop next week, and hope to organize a data carpentry in the spring.
