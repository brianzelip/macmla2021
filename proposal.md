## Title

Building capacity to provide in-demand data analysis skills

## Background

This session will share lessons learned from hosting online Library Carpentry workshops and describe how these experiences will shape our plans for future offerings. The Carpentries is a non-profit organization dedicated to building computational and data science skills through inclusive, hands-on workshops. Library Carpentry – one of three established workshop curricula – aims to build these skills in library workers. After cancelling a planned in-person workshop in March 2020, our organization hosted two online Library Carpentry workshops.

## Description

Both workshops were delivered online live via Zoom to librarians in the region. The first workshop was held over three afternoons in November 2020 with 20 registrants, and the second over two full days in March 2021 with 19 registrants. The combined workshop topics included Regular Expressions, the UNIX Shell, Git, OpenRefine, Tidy Data, and R. The Carpentries recruited instructors and provided organizational support to the host institution. Workshop helpers were recruited locally. Participants had the opportunity to provide feedback before, during, and after the workshops.

## Conclusions

The online format presented numerous challenges, including: handling technical questions, managing multiple applications, facilitating interaction, and pacing lessons. Some instructors were more accustomed to the online format than others and, with different instructors for different lessons, it was difficult to iteratively refine as the workshop progressed.

For the second workshop, an adjusted curriculum and schedule combined with fewer instructors led to more consistency. And the frequent effective use of breakout rooms contributed to an improved student experience.

We built our capacity to self-organize Carpentries workshops in Spring 2021, when three of us became certified Carpentries instructors. By managing all aspects of workshop scheduling and instructor recruitment, we will have more flexibility and control to apply the lessons learned from these initial two workshops to future offerings.
