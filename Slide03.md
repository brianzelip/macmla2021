# Working toward self-hosting LC workshops


## Certified Carpentry Instructor Training

Many attendees of the workshop completed the steps to become Carpentries Certified instructors. 
Those steps were:

1. Attend a week of training led by certified instructors

2. Complete the follow up tasks of contributing to a lesson or some other Carpentries content, Attending a community session, and Mock teaching exercise. 

## Advantages and challenges we forsee with self-hosting

### Advantages

1. More control over planning timeline
    - With a centrally organized workshop, you’re bound to the Carpentries organization’s timeline. They don’t start recruiting instructors until two months before the planned workshop date. For our centrally organized workshops, we didn’t have confirmed instructors until about a month before the event. We typically like to open registration and promote events further in advance, especially for such a time-intensive (16 hours) event.

2. Build rapport between instructors. Smoother co-teaching experience.

3. Don’t have to pay administrative fee for each workshop.

### Challenges

1. Finding instructors and helpers available for the time you want to run a self-hosted workshop

2. NNLM staffing to coordinate a self-hosted workshop when there isnt someone

## Reflections from hosting previous LC workshops
